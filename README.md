# Capstone FaceMaskRemoval

The global pandemic known as COIVD-19 has been part of our lives for over the past two years,
and alongside COVID-19 came the global-wide mask mandate policy which continues to be
enforced in some parts of the world. As it was widely noticed, computer vision – such as the
kind used on phones to biometrically authorise a user – had a hard time reliably recognizing a
face with a face mask on.

This Project will allow a user to insert an input image of a subject wearing a face mask and output an image with and AI generated face where the face mask used to be.
